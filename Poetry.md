I am from an ever-changing environment

A wall of ocean breeze which parts the seas

just in time for holiday

I am of my friends who live on in memories

of my family who helps me renew

I am from Bardufoss to Iguazu 

Oahu to Kittery, Maine

I am unendingly self critical 

A pool of internal strife housed with unfounded optimism

I am of guilt~

could I have found my grandmother in time

or before the frostbite claimed his toes

I am leaning into the current as I dream of the clouds

with thoughts of yesterday—when I thought..

I am at altitude yet I crave for the touch of the foam of lone and peaceful eddy

I am(erican) 

and, despite our faults

I am proud

I am feathers and fur—bound to a hook

I am a hook for a song not yet wrote

I am barely me and mostly you 

I am 

today

not yet done
